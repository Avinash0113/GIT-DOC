list_1= [1,2,5,3,9,5,26,53,95,] , output should be the list and first index should be divided by second like respectively

list_1= [1,2,5,3,9,5,26,53,95,] print list in reverse order

Write a code that all 0's in the list should move to right-side , list_1= [8,0,0,65,79,0,21,0,0,0,54,12]

String= "ffgyytuuugg" write a code to print that first unique character and position of that character

list_1 = [1,2,10,3,4,2,5,6,8,9,11] write a code to print 1st & 2nd largest number from the list



Input ⇒ Welcome Yagna!  ,   given input string should be reversed, but the condition is that last
                            special character and space between the words should be in its
                            index position even after reversing the string
 this is the expected output
Output ⇒ angaYem ocleW!


In given string vowels should be replaced with numbers, do it with for loop and Regex

String_1="986758h49ghsdfe#$%@3h4" using Regex and looping get only numbers as output
 
 
Input= [(2, 3), (4, 5), (6, 7), (2, 8)] each tuple should be multiply and output should be in list as below
	Output: [6, 20, 42, 16]
