A array (or list or equivalent) F1 has got names of Facebook users and their friend association.

For example if we write:  User1, User2 it implies that User1 is a friend of User2. This also implies that User2 is a friend of User1.

Write a program which will parse F1 and remove duplicates and write all the unique pairs to a new array F2.

 
For example, the array F1 might have the following data:

U1,U2

U3,U4

U1,U5

U2,U1

U3,U4

 
Array F2 should now have:

U1,U2

U3,U4

U1,U5
