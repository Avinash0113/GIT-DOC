1. 

Write a program which takes two strings as input from the user (str1 and str2). This program should print two strings as output (op1 and op2).

op1 should contain all the characters which are present in str1 but NOT present in str2.

op2 should contain all the characters which are present in str2 but NOT present in str1.

 

For example:

				str1	str2			op1		op2
 	
Example-1		ABC		BC				A		<null>

Example-2		BC		BANGALORE		C		ANGLORE


 


2.

A array (or list or equivalent) F1 has got names of Facebook users and their friend association.

For example if we write:  User1, User2 it implies that User1 is a friend of User2. This also implies that User2 is a friend of User1.

Write a program which will parse F1 and remove duplicates and write all the unique pairs to a new array F2.

For example, the array F1 might have the following data:

U1,U2
U3,U4
U1,U5
U2,U1
U3,U4

 
Array F2 should now have:

U1,U2
U3,U4
U1,U5
